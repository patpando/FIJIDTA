FIJI (Fiji Is Just ImageJ) Derivative Threshold Analysis
Extranuclear DNA bodies are cellular structures containing DNA that are separate from the primary nucleus and surrounded by a nuclear envelope. Extranuclear DNA bodies arise in mammalian cells primarily during mitosis and are called micronuclei (MN). MN have been extensively studied as they are frequently observed in human cancer cells, and their presence correlates with DNA damage and/or aberrant chromosome segregation. Similar to human cancer cells, the model eukaryote Tetrahymena thermophila produces extranuclear DNA bodies, called chromatin extrusion bodies (EBs). EBs are structurally similar to MN and are also correlated with DNA damage and chromatin disruptions. Importantly, the molecular processes that produce and govern EB fate in Tetrahymena are not fully understood. Currently, the quantification of MN and EBs is primarily achieved by calculating their frequency and/or manually outlining their shape to measure area. Although useful, manual outlining is time-consuming, difficult to reproduce, and prone to human bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a semi-automated method of measuring an EB’s area: FIJI derivative threshold analysis for centered circles (FIJIDTAcc). This method is reproducible and robust across microscope modalities, enabling the scientific community to more accurately compare the sizes of extranuclear DNA bodies across experiments and biological systems.
